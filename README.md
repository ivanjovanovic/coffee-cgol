# Conway's Game Of Life implementation in CoffeeScript

This is simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/).

For seeing it in action, clone this repository and open index.html file
in a fairly recent browser (IE9+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari should work).

For playing with it you will need `Ruby` and `bundler` for start. Then
just do

`bundle install`

and you'll get all gems you need.
To run tests do

`bundle exec rake jasmine`

If you would like to edit `.coffee` files you will like to enable guard
so your `.js` files are automatically updated. Just run

`guard`

in the root of the project.
